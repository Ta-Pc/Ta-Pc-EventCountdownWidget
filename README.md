### üé® Design Philosophy

The design is heavily inspired by **Swiss Style** graphic design principles, emphasizing:
*   **Clarity & Readability:** A clean, legible sans-serif font with a strong information hierarchy.
*   **High Contrast:** Text color is carefully chosen to ensure legibility in all themes.
*   **Minimalism:** A flat, modern aesthetic with uniformly rounded corners and no unnecessary visual clutter. The focus is on the content itself.
*   **Consistency:** A cohesive design language across all widgets and configuration screens.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

This application is a practical demonstration of modern Android widget development, focusing on a clean architecture and best practices.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to see Architecture and Key Components</strong></summary>

  #### Architecture
  *   **AppWidgetProvider:** The core logic for each widget (`EventCountdownWidget`, `SimpleEventListWidgetProvider`) is managed by its own provider, handling widget lifecycle events.
  *   **Configuration Activities:** Dedicated `Activity` classes (`WidgetConfigActivity`, `SimpleListWidgetConfigActivity`) handle user setup for each widget instance.
  *   **RemoteViewsService:** The scrollable `ListView` in the Event List widget is powered by a `RemoteViewsService` (`EventListWidgetService`), which is the standard, performant way to display collections in widgets.
  *   **Separation of Concerns:** Helper classes like `CalendarRepository`, `CountdownFormatter`, and `ThemeManager` are used to create a modular and maintainable codebase.

  #### Key Android Components & APIs
  *   **`AppWidgetManager`:** Manages all aspects of widget creation, updates, and deletion.
  *   **`RemoteViews`:** Builds the widget UI that runs in the home screen launcher process.
  *   **`AlarmManager` & `BroadcastReceiver`:** A robust system for scheduling reliable, minute-by-minute automatic updates (`WidgetUpdateReceiver`) and ensuring they resume after a device reboot (`BootReceiver`).
  *   **`CalendarContract.Instances`:** The primary Android API for efficiently querying calendar event instances within a specific time range.
  *   **`SharedPreferences`:** Persists user configuration for each unique widget instance.
  *   **Material Components:** Used for creating the modern, consistent UI in the configuration activities.
